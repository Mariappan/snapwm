I started this from catwm 31/12/10 ( https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=100215&p=1 )
See DMiniWM.c or config.h for thanks and licensing.


##Summary
##-------


**DMiniWM** is a very minimal and lightweight dynamic tiling window manager.
    I will try to stay under 1000 SLOC.
    Currently well under 900 lines with the config file included.


##Modes
##-----

It allows the "normal" method of tiling window managers(with the new window as the master)
    and with the new window opened at the bottom of the stack(like dwm's attach_aside)

    *There's vertical tiling mode:*
    --------------
    |        |   |
    |        |___|
    | Master |   |
    |        |___|
    |        |   |
    --------------

    *Horizontal tiling mode:*
    -------------
    |           |
    |  Master   |
    |-----------|
    |   |   |   |
    -------------
    
    *Grid tiling mode:*
    -------------
    |      |    |
    |      |    |
    |------|----|
    |      |    |
    -------------

    *Fullscreen mode*(which you'll know when you see it)

    All accessible with keyboard shortcuts defined in the config.h file.
    Changing a tiling mode on one workspace doesn't affect the other workspaces.

    The unique save_desktop function allows the window manager
        to remember the tiling mode for each workspace for the session.

##Installation
##------------

Need Xlib, then:
    $ make ( I stop at this step and run the wm from the dir I built it in )
        {I use the command
            cd build/DMiniWM/src && make clean && make && cd || cd }

    # make install
    $ make clean
