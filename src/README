I started this from catwm 31/12/10 ( https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=100215&p=1 )
See DMiniWM.c or config.h for thanks and licensing.


Summary
-------

DMiniWM is a very minimal and lightweight dynamic tiling window manager.
    I will try to stay under 1000 SLOC.
    Currently well under 900 lines with the config file included.

Status
------

There are more options in the config file than the original catwm.
    Fixed the window manager crashing on a bad window error.
    Fixed the keyboard shortcuts not working if numlock was on.
    Added some functions.
    Added an option to focus the window the mouse just moved to.

Modes
-----

It allows the "normal" method of tiling window managers(with the new window as the master)
    and with the new window opened at the bottom of the stack(like dwm's attach_aside)

    There's vertical tiling mode:
    --------------
    |        |   |
    |        |___|
    | Master |   |
    |        |___|
    |        |   |
    --------------

    Horizontal tiling mode:
    -------------
    |           |
    |  Master   |
    |-----------|
    |   |   |   |
    -------------

    Fullscreen mode(which you'll know when you see it)

    all accessible with keyboard shortcuts defined in the config.h file.
    changing a tiling mode on one workspace doesn't affect the other workspaces.
    
    the unique save_desktop function allows the window manager
        to remember the tiling mode for each workspace for the session.


Installation
------------

Need Xlib, then:
    $ make ( I stop at this step and run the wm from the dir I built it in )
        {I use the command
            cd build/DMiniWM/src && make clean && make && cd || cd }

    # make install
    $ make clean
