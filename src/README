I started this from catwm
Summary
-------

DMiniWM is a very simple and lightweight tiling window manager.
I will try to stay under 1000 SLOC.

Modes
-----

It allows the "normal" modes of tiling window managers(with the new window as the master)
	and with the new window opened at the bottom of the stack(like dwm's attach_aside)
    There's vertical tiling:
    --------------
    |        |___|
    |        |___|
    | Master |___|
    |        |___|
    |        |___|
    --------------
    horizontal tiling:
    -------------
    |           |
    |  Master   |
    |-----------|
    |   |   |   |
    -------------
    fullscreen mode(which you'll know when you see it)


Installation
------------

Need Xlib, then:
    $ make
    # make install
    $ make clean
