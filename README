The Good First One With A Popup URXVT.

added bad window error catching
       DMiniWM doesn't crash when changing desktops and there is a window missing
can remove the popup urxvtc now
Removed the popup urxvtc
added code to catch when numlock is on so it works on all my comps !

need to stop the window manager still showing a bordered space for the bad window

with FOLLOW_MOUSE 0 in the config move the mouse to a new window and it will be focused
